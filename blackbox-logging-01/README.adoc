= Simplest blackbox tracing demo

The original used some Boost includes:

* `<boost/type_traits.hpp>` => `<type_traits>`
* `<boost/utility/enable_if.hpp>` => `<type_traits>`

Correspondingly, changed

* `boost::true_type` to `std::true_type`
* `boost::false_type` to `std::false_type`

Also

* `boost::disable_if_c` becomes `std::enable_if`, with the test negated.
* `boost::is_arithmetic` with `std::is_arithmetic`
* `boost::is_float` with `std::is_floating_point`
* `boost::is_same` with `std::is_same`
* `boost::is_enum` with `std::is_enum`
* `boost::is_array`` with `std::is_array`
* `boost::remove_const` with `std::remove_const`
* `boost::remove_bounds` with `std::remove_extent`
* `boost::is_pointer` with `std::is_pointer`

The exe wasn't working after fixing errors and warnings.
Possibly related to previously using 32-bit exe,
because I saw IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32.
Changing a couple of things to 64 allows the sections to be located.

Finally, fixing a simple error where it had been assumed that at least
one command-line argument was given allowed it to run.
